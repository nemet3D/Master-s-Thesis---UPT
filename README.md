# LaTeX template for UPT theses

This is a LaTeX template created according to the guidelines for UPT MMUT department theses in 2019. **Always check the [current formatting guidelines][thesis-guidelines] before you hand in.** See [`build/main.pdf`][sample-pdf] for an example PDF created with this template.

Comments & contributions welcome!

## Quickstart

 * [Download][template-download] and extract the template, or upload it to an online editor such as [Overleaf][overleaf] or [ShareLaTeX][sharelatex]. If you prefer to use Git, just clone/fork the repository.
 * If your editor provides support for compiling LaTeX, set it up to use `pdflatex` and `biber`. Set the master document to `main.tex`. Alternatively, you can use the provided Makefile to generate a PDF in the `build` directory (requires `latexmk`).
 * Look for `TODO` comments in the provided files. Start at `main.tex`.

If you are new to LaTeX, the [ShareLaTeX knowledge base][sharelatex-kb] or the [LaTeX Wikibook][latex-wikibook] might help.

For additional hints, have a look at [the wiki][wiki]. If you still have problems with the template, feel free to [create an issue][issue]. For general LaTeX questions, use [TeX StackExchange][tex-se].
